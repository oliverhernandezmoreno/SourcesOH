title: Target configuration
description: >-
  Configuration is performed first by declaring an inventory. Said
  inventory is declared in terms of three types of entities: _groups_,
  _sources_ and _parameters_. After the inventory is declared, the
  stability indices may be applied to the system. Afterwards, final
  adjustments may be performed to the individual _time series_
  generated, such as threshold and frequency definition. **This
  schema** governs the first and third phases of the process.


definitions:
  Pattern:
    title: Expansion pattern
    description: >-
      An expression to expand definitions with, it uses the
      elements within to generate several copies of the definition
      with the altered placeholders according to the variable used
      (e.g. with_n replaces 'n' in templates). Several
      replacements produce a cross-product of replacements, so two
      replacements with two and three values each would produce
      six copies of the declaration.
